<h1>Introduction </h1>
<h3>天才欧拉</h3>
<p>    
    The Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707–83) was all but blind when he
    moved to St Petersburg in 1766 for a second stint as the star of the Russian Imperial
    Academy of Sciences. He had lost vision in his right eye 28 years before; a cataract
    （白内障）was claiming his left. Yet Euler, then 59, boasted in one letter that the loss
    of sight meant “one more distraction removed”. From then on, his productivity
    increased. More than half of his eventual output of 866 publications was published
    either over the remaining 17 years of his life or posthumously.
</p>
<p>
    The publication of Euler’s collected works, which began in 1911, is still
    unfinished; it will fill more than 80 large volumes. There are also hundreds of letters
    — many with as much scientific content as the best of his papers. Leonhard Euler,
    written by historian of mathematics Ronald Calinger, is perhaps the first biography
    that attempts to offer a panoramic view of this immense body of work.
</p>

<h3 id="achievements">伟大成就</h3>

<p>
    Euler dominated almost all branches of mathematics, as well as physics,
    astronomy and engineering, during the Enlightenment era. Euler's mathematics was
    often ahead of his time. He foreshadowed the use of groups of symmetries, the
    topology of networks, decision theory and the theory of sets (he was, for instance, the
    first to draw Venn diagrams). Nearly alone among his contemporaries, he advocated
    for the beauty and importance of number theory. His work on prime numbers, in
    particular, set the stage for a golden age of mathematics that would follow decades
    later.
</p>
<p>
    However, Euler's greatest legacy, in both pure and applied mathematics, was the
    field of analysis. Seventeenth-century mathematicians, culminating with Isaac
    Newton and his arch-enemy Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, had founded calculus — the
    study of the rates of change of quantities in time (differentials or derivatives) and the
    intimately related idea of areas between curves (integrals). Euler's analysis turned
    calculus into a powerful science and endowed mathematics and physics with their
    modern language and appearance.
</p>

<p>
    The founders of calculus often grasped at concepts that they could not fully
    understand. The field relied on infinitesimals（无限小）, which had a metaphysical
    aura so controversial that they were in part responsible for getting Galileo Galilei in
    hot water with the Catholic Church, according to historian of mathematics Amir
    Alexander . In Euler's time, that controversy was still far from resolved. There were no
    rigorous definitions of limits or of the continuum of the real numbers; neither was put
    onto solid foundations until the nineteenth century.

</p>
<p>
    Just as he was not upset by blindness, Euler did not let these troubles hinder his
    mathematical creativity. In his treatment of infinitesimals — used in differential and
    integral calculus and in adding up infinite series — he took an approach that Calinger
    describes as “happy-go-lucky”. Euler's pragmatism is reminiscent of the 'shut up and
    calculate' attitude of the vast majority of twentieth-century physicists towards
    quantum mechanics, setting problematic foundations aside to allow enormous
    progress in applications. Euler's powers of intuition and his method of testing his
    hypotheses on special cases using his unparalleled calculation skills meant that his
    results were almost always right, says Calinger.

<h3 id="analysis">数学分析</h3>

<p>
    At the centre of analysis, Euler placed the concept of differential equations: those
    that link a function and its derivatives, and in which the solution consists of
    calculating the function itself. He came to be regarded as the “principal inventor” of
    the field, Calinger writes, and his work on analysis “displaced synthetic Euclidean
    geometry from its two-millennium primacy”. Euler demonstrated the power of this innovative science when he applied it to
    physical problems, such as the laws of the mechanics of solid bodies. In particular, he
    solved what many in the eighteenth century considered the most important open
    problem in astronomy: reconciling the complex motions of the Moon with Newton's
    universal law of gravitation. This “'three-body problem” involves the interactions of
    the Sun, Moon and Earth, and is much harder than predicting one planet's motion
    around the Sun. Some, including Euler, had suspected that Newton's inverse-square
    law (平方反比律) would break down in this crucial test, demanding the formulation
    of another theory. The problem had enormous practical importance: lunar motions
    could be used to calculate a vessel's longitude (经度）at sea, and Euler was in the race
    to find a reliable method of doing so.

    Euler was a man of integrity who — with few exceptions — gave credit where it
    was due and maintained a belief in “a harmony between written revelation and natural
    phenomena”. He led a long and extremely prolific mathematical life, contributing
    greatly to the evolution of mathematics. On September 18, 1783, Euler died from a
    brain hemorrhage in St. Petersburg. After his death, the Academy at St. Petersburg
    continued publishing his works for about 50 years.

    四月是你的谎言中 我们每个人都需要一个能给自己道别之吻的人 是什么意思？
    
    此生有君足矣

    谈个心里此刻最现实的感受
    
    当你知道跟TA已经无路如何都不能够继续下去哪怕从来没有过过正式的开始。
    
    哪怕之前都是另一种掩饰或者身份下的经历。
    
    在你知道一切都不可能的时候。
    
    心里乱的要被撑爆。
    
    心里想不了任何其他事情的时候突然发现。
    
    自己什么都可以不要。
    
    只想要跟TA在一起。
    
    但是立马又会被现实打败时。
    
    只能够默默回忆曾经的一切。
    
    回忆一次。
    
    哭一次。
    
    心里被撕碎一次。
    
    痛苦到不能言语。
    
    这就是那个给你离别之吻的人。
    
    你真正爱着的那个人。
    
    为什么人非要到失去才知道真心？
    
    才知道珍惜。
    
    心碎。方知真心。
    
    小薰说的每个人都需要一个离别之吻的人。实际上说的哪里只是离别之吻。实际上说的是。每个人都会遇到那个真心爱着但是就是不能在一起的人。无论多爱多爱。即不能说出来。还自己压不住自己的内心。现实中想在一起但是却无法在一起的那个人。
    
    其中被撕裂的心痛。却只能自己默默承受。

    心中再次呼喊、再次怀疑：你是这样的人吗？追随着你的脚步，不要停下、不要停下！！！

    但是你是在想碰到小薰一样的人吗？不要等到失去了才懂得珍惜，不然永远迷失在自己的世界中

    当你期待能遇到一个这样的人时你明明有机会成为她，等着她出现不是太被动了吗
